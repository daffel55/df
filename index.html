      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>In fact I am a retired children and adolescent psychiatrist (that's a shrink for people younger than 21) and neither programmer nor web designer. But I'd always longed to be one!
        <br> Ever since I owned a Commodore 128 and later several Amigas I kept myself busy learning Programmer's languages, such as Basic, Amiga Basic, Pascal, Delphi, Visual Basic, you name it.
        <br>But as I had a different (and sometimes difficult) full time job, I never came as far as I'd wished to. Managed to wrtite some smaller programs for praxis routines but that was all of it.
        <br>Now after I first started to work less and recently retired fully, I came back to that old passion. I did a course at community college, read some books and visited online workshops on Java and JavaFX, which was fun. Then I started to
        deal with XCode and Swift, but lost interest (or was frustated, as I had some problems with XCode/Swift)
        <br>After a short dance with Flutter and Dart I am now navigating through HTML, CSS and Javascript. So let's wait and see what derives from all of this. <br>It is fun anyway to learn and give it a try.

        <h2>My Other Hobbies:</h2>
        <h3>Playing Music</h3>
        <img class="skill-img" src="images/musik.png" alt="musik-img">
        <p>I'm an amateur, a dilettante in different ways on my approach to music and musical instruments.</p>
        <p><em>Historically, the amateur was considered to be the ideal balance between pure intent, open mind, and the interest or passion for a subject</em> (this is quoted from Wikipedia). </p>
        <p>That is a good description on how I make music. To me playing music is one of the most relaxing, touching, inspiring activities. To jam with others or to just improvise in your living room is pure joy. It is not for nothing that dilettante
          derives from Italian dilettante(“to delight”) or from Latin dēlectāre (“to delight”).</p>
        <p>But on the other hand I am also dilettantish, as I don't practise on a regular basis, don't do etudes, can't decide, which instrument I want to master but play various instruments like piano and keyboard, drum set and other percussion
          instruments, bass gitar and electronic musik with Ableton and Push on a basic to average level.<set></set>

        <h3>Learning Languages</h3>
        <img class="skill-img" src="images/sprachen.png" alt="sprachen-img">

        <p>My first language is German. <br>
          <br>I learned English, Latin and very sparce French in school. English I trained with watching movies and series coming from English (or American or Australian or Canadian or whatsoever Englishish language) speaking countries or reading
          books etc., French and Latin are almost forgotten
          .
          <br>
          <br>I speak and foremost understand Dutch nearly fluently as my wife is Dutch.
          <br>
          <br>I learned Norwegian which is far more difficult than I expected. They have a million different ways to pronounce and use words. It is quite easy to read a newspaper but to understand somebody talking about the weather is still quite
          impossible for me.

        <h3>And there are more passions:</h3>
        <p>I like to work in our shop and do woodworking, building furniture or little bowls and boxes. <br>
          <br>I am a quite skilled illustrator, both digital and analog. I like painting and printing. I like to experiment with different materials such as encaustic waxes, collages or mixed media.
        </p>
        <br>I do walks and hiking tours, I love Scandinavia (and Scotland). We travel with our VW-Bus and a small trailer and enjoy being in the natur.
        <br>And then of course reading, watching series and films, meeting friends, visit exhibitions and other cultural stuff, caring for our dog and sit in our huge garden, watching things to grow and the forest trying to take over our area (mostly
        welcomed to do so).
